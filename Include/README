The *.c files in this directory allow you to create two stand-alone
programs that will give you the size of various Imperium objects.
For most users they are useless, which is why they don't get compiled
by default.

However, if you intend to modify the Imperium request structure or any
datatype used in the ImpState_t structure you can make use of them to
see if you need to increase any of the "private size" #define's to
compensate for growth/alignment changes.
